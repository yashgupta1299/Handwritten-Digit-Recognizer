FCNN Model

## Project Overview
The FCNN classification models were developed using various optimization algorithms, including SGD, VGD, SGD(momentum), SGD(NAG), AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam. These models were designed to classify digits and achieved a best performance accuracy of 98.42%. Additionally, a detailed report was also created.
